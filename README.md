# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset of real transaction records.

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, featuring anonymized input variables.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the dataset and analyze class distribution and feature statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, scale features, and address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.

3. **Model Training**  
   Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Visualization**  
   Visualize data distributions, feature importance, and model results.
